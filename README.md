# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## My Goal
In this app, I have used and performed various Dart programming concepts and utilized open-source Flutter packages. I have created a simple xylophone app that plays sounds for each button touch.

## What I Have Created
I designed a simple UI app that resembles a small xylophone. The app plays different sounds based on the touch inputs on the screen.

## Package Used
- [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers)

## Course
This Flutter application was built to create different sounds when touching different tabs in the app. In this app, I used the 'audioplayers' package from the Dart package container. This app was created during the course "The Complete 2020 Flutter Bootcamp with Dart," in collaboration with the Google Flutter team and The London App Brewery, instructed by Dr. Angela Yu.
